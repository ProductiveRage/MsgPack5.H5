It's crucial that the namespace of these classes NOT begin with MsgPack5.H5 because it's imperative that the attribute resolution - [MessagePack], [Key], [Union], etc - be done via the preprocessor conditional usings and NOT due to the fact that there are classes
in the same namespace - eg. if the classes in this project were in the namespace MsgPack.H5.SharedTypes then it could resolve the [MessagePack] to MsgPack.H5.MessagePackAttribute, which won't be what we want when not in a H5 build
- TODO [2020-06-03 DWR]: This might all go away when there are proper end-to-end tests available where the test data is generated by .NET and then read by a H5 unit test project
